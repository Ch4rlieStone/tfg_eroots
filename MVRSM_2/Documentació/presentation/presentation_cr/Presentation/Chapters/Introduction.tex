% \subsection{Motivation}
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variable renewable energy like wind and solar is becoming increasingly prevalent in the electrical grid.
    \item The presence of these sources is leads to unwanted effects in the grid such as overvoltages and voltage imbalances.  
    \item Historic solutions are not well equipped to deal with these effects and especially the fast response times required.
    \item New power electronics based solutions, such as the unified power quality converter (UPQC), are investigated to solve this problem.
\end{itemize}

% \subsection{Goals}
\begin{frame}{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item To analyze voltage spread of distribution grid with high penetration of solar.
\item To develop a dynamic model of the UPQC, including all required controllers.
\item To develop an equivalent static model of the UPQC and validate its behaviour with the dynamic model.
\item To propose design methodology for the converter sizing making use of the developed tools.
\item To show behaviour of the converter over sample days using different design criteria.
\end{itemize}

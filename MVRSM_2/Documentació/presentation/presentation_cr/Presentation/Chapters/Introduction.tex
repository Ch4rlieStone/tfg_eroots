% \subsection{Motivation}
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increasing need and demand for renewable energy sources, such as wind power.
    \item Trade-off between investment costs and technical constraints when designing the transmission system of an Offshore Wind Power Plant (OWPP).
    \item Need for new optimization tools for multi-objective, mixed variable and non-linear optimization problems.
    \item Industry interest, such as Acciona, in developing software for this purpose.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


% \subsection{Goals}
\begin{frame}{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Model all the elements of the HVAC transmission system of an OWPP.
\item Implement a Power Flow solver in Python.
\item Formulate the optimization problem of the reactive power compensation and the transmission system design.
\item Design and implement an optimization algorithm in Python that allows to find the Pareto Frontier of optimal solutions.
\end{itemize}

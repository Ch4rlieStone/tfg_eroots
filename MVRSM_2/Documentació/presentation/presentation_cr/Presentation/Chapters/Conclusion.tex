% \begin{frame}{Conclusions}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item A new classification of buses has been proposed. A modified Newton-Raphson algorithm that considers the current equation of converters has been developed.
%         \item It has been found possible in a simple system to algebraically include the current limits of converters with a formulation based on a Lagrangian.
%         \item The voltage-support provided by conventional grid codes can be improved. The adapted grid codes are concluded to be near-optimal.
%         \item The Galerkin method has been studied. A generalized program to solve realistic grids with small errors has been written. 
%         \item The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with dimension reduction yields satisfactory errors and is much more efficient than the Galerkin method. The parametrized states can be used in optimization problems.

\begin{frame}{Future work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider wind speed distribution, i.e. variable power injection.
        \item Consider HVDC trasmission system comparision.
        \item Electrical collection system layout optimization.
        \item Further development of the costs functions.
        \item Integration into existing software, i.e. GridCal.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Future work}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item To develop heuristics to determine the states of the converters and how to switch between them in order to get to a solution.
%         \item To develop the Lagrangian formulation for AC systems in order to realistically include converters' current limits.
%         \item Study the optimality of grid codes in distribution grids.
%         \item Parametrize the fault impedances instead of the powers. This way, obtaining results for a sweep of fault impedances could be significantly faster.
%         \item Test other families of bases for the Galerkin method such as Chebyshev polynomials.
%     \end{itemize}
